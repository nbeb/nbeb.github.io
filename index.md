Welcome to my webpage!

I'm Nikos, a [lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Fluid Mechanics](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/n.bempedelis) at the School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). 

My [research](/research) focuses on modelling flows that are encountered in energy, transportation, environmental and biomedical engineering applications. I am particularly interested in studying cavitation and bubble dynamics as well as wind energy aerodynamics through a combination of numerical simulations, theory, and data-driven techniques.

Before joining QMUL, I was a postdoctoral research associate at Imperial College London. I hold a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from UCL, an MSc in Aerospace Mechanics and Avionics from ISAE-SUPAERO, and a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens.
